1> Latest vanilla js(ES6) does have class concept.
2> OOPs (oriented oriented programming) - works with real life entities.
3> Differences between classes and objects:

    Objects:
        -> The things we work within the code
        -> instances of class (based on class)

    Class:
        -> Blueprint for objects (Theoretical definition)
        -> define how objects looks like, what method and behaviour they have
        -> classes make creation of multiple similar objects much easier

4> Creat a simple typescript class

    class Departement{
        name: string;
        constructor(n: string){
            this.name = n;
        }
    }
    const accouting = new Departement('Accouning');
    console.log(accouting);

5> class Departement{
        name: string;
        constructor(n: string){
            this.name = n;
        }
        desribe(){
            console.log(`Department is ${this.name}`);
        }
    }
    const accouting = new Departement('Accouning');
    accouting.desribe(); 

    // this refers to the object by which we call the method.
    // Inside describe method, this refers to the Departement object i.e accounting

6> We can explicitly pass this params in method for better understanding and clarity.

    class Departement{
        name: string;
        constructor(n: string){
            this.name = n;
        }
        desribe(this: Departement){
            console.log(`Department is ${this.name}`);
        }
    }
    const accouting = new Departement('Accouning');
    accouting.desribe();

7> Access modifier
    -> If we don't mention the modifier, it will be public by default.
       class Departement{
            name: string;    // public name: string  (both are same code)
            .......
    -> public means we can access that data or method from outside of class also.

    -> if the modifier is private , we can access those within the class only.

    -> sometimes we don't want to access the members of class from outside.

    -> we have one more modifier i.e, protected that we will see later.

    -> Example :-
        class Departement{
            name: string;
            private employees: string[] = [];
            constructor(n: string){
                this.name = n;
            }
            desribe(this: Departement){
                console.log(`Department is ${this.name}`);
            }
            addEmployee(employee: string){
                this.employees.push(employee);
            }
            printEmployee(){
                if(this.employees.length === 0){
                    console.log('There is no employee to print');
                }else{
                    for(let emp of this.employees){
                        console.log(emp);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        const accouting = new Departement('Accouning');
        accouting.addEmployee('Manu');
        accouting.addEmployee('Ana');
        accouting.printEmployee();


8> Shorthand initialization
    class Departement{
        name: string;
        id: string;
        constructor(name: string, id: string){
            this.name = name;
            this.id = id;
        }
    }

    The above code can also be written as below
    class Departement{
        constructor(public name: string, public id: string){
        }
    }

9> Readonly properties
    We know const varaibles can't be reinitialized. But class members (variables) dont use let or const.
    They can be access using this keyword.
    So we use Readonly for those variables that shouldn't be reinitialized.

    class Circle{
        private readonly PI = 3.14;
        constructor(private radius: number){}
        area(){
            this.PI = 0;  // Cannot assign to 'PI' because it is a read-only property.
            console.log(this.PI * this.radius * this.radius);''
        }
    }
    const c1 = new Circle(7);
    const c2 = new Circle(14);
    c1.area();
    c2.area();

10> Inheritance
    -> any this statement can only be used after super keyword statement.
    Example :-

        class LivingBody{
            no_of_hands: number;
            no_of_legs: number;
            constructor(no_of_hands: number, no_of_legs: number){
                this.no_of_hands = no_of_hands;
                this.no_of_legs = no_of_legs;
            }
        }
        class Human extends LivingBody{
            isIntelligence: boolean;
            constructor(no_of_hands: number, no_of_legs: number, isIntelligence: boolean){
                super(no_of_hands, no_of_legs);
                this.isIntelligence = isIntelligence;
            }
            getDetails(){
                return `Hands: ${this.no_of_hands}, Legs: ${this.no_of_legs}, Intelligent: ${this.isIntelligence}`;
            }
        }
        class Animal extends LivingBody{
            constructor(no_of_hands: number, no_of_legs: number){
                super(no_of_hands, no_of_legs);
            }
            getDetails(){
                return `Hands: ${this.no_of_hands}, Legs: ${this.no_of_legs}`;
            }
        }
        const human1 = new Human(2,2,true);
        const animal1 = new Animal(0,4);

        console.log(human1.getDetails());
        console.log(animal1.getDetails());

11> Method overriding
    -> we can override the base class method in sub class
    -> base class data should be of protected type if we are going to use in sub class.
       private data can only be used within the class and public is accessed everywhere.

       class Department{
            protected employees: string[];  // protected data
            constructor(){
                this.employees = [];
            }
            addEmployees(employee: string){
                this.employees.push(employee);
            }   
        }
        class ITDepartment extends Department{
            constructor(){
                super();
            }
            addEmployees(employee: string): void {  // method overriding
                if(employee !== 'max'){
                    this.employees.push(employee);
                }
            }
        }


14> Getter and setter

    class Employee{
        private empName: string;
        get mostRecentEmpName(){   // work as a function, we can write more complex logic
            return this.empName;
        }
        set mostRecentEmpName(name){  // work as a function, we can write more complex logic
            this.empName = name;
        }
        constructor(name: string){
            this.empName = name;
        }
    }
    const emp1 = new Employee('Manu');
    console.log(emp1.mostRecentEmpName);  // access as a value not method ->getter
    emp1.mostRecentEmpName = 'lakshmi';   // access as a value not method ->setter
    console.log(emp1.mostRecentEmpName);

15> static methods and properties
    -> static methods and properties are those member which doesn't need instance of any class to access it.
    -> we must have seen Math class properties and methods. Math.pow(2,4)
       Here wo dont create instance first for math class like const m1 = new Math(); 
       We directly use Math.pow(2,4) , it means pow is a static method. We generally create
       utility method as a static method in a class.

    -> static member can never be accessed through this keyword and it is expected.

    -> 
        class Calculator{
            public static PI = 3.14;  // or static PI = 3.14;
            constructor(){}
            static findArea(radius: number){
                return Calculator.PI * radius * radius;
            }
        }
        const ans = Calculator.findArea(10);
        console.log(ans);


16> Abstract class
    -> We are seeing below getvalue of base class is overridden in all subclass, then what is the need
       of implementation in base class? In this scenerio we make the method as abstract(which doesn't have implementation)

    -> abstract method can only be placed in abstract class

    -> it also force all subclass to override that abstract method or properties

    -> we can't initiate abstract class with new operator, infact there is no need

        class A{
            constructor(protected name: string){}
            getvalue(): string{
                return 'Value of A is ->' +this.name
            }
        }
        class B extends A{
            constructor(){
                super('B');
            }
            getvalue(): string {
                return 'Value of B is ->' +this.name
            }
        }
        class C extends A{
            constructor(){
                super('C');
            }
            getvalue(): string {
                return 'Value of C is ->' +this.name
            }
        }

    -> Example with abstract class

        abstract class A{
            protected abstract age: number
            constructor(protected name: string){}
            
            abstract getvalue(): string;
        }
        class B extends A{
            protected age: number =10;  // modifier should also match protected in base class
            constructor(){
                super('B');
            }
            getvalue(): string {
            
                return 'Value of B is ->' +this.name
            }
        }
        class C extends A{
            protected age: number =20; // modifier should also match protected in base class
            constructor(){
                super('C');
            }
            getvalue(): string {  // overriding
                return 'Value of C is ->' +this.name
            }
        }


16> Singletons and private constructor
    -> If we need only one instance of any class then we can do achieve using private constructor
    -> the moment we make the constructor private then we never use new operator to create the instance
       from the outside
    -> from outside the class, we can call any static method , because calling static method doesn't need
       new operator. It is called by class name.

    -> Example: -
    
    class Department{
        private static instance: Department;
        static getInstance(deptname: string, state: string){
            if(Department.instance){
                return this.instance;
            }else{
                this.instance = new Department(deptname, state);
                return this.instance;
            }
        }
        private constructor(private name: string, private state: string){}
    }
    const d1 = Department.getInstance('d1', 'Bihar')
    const d2 = Department.getInstance('d2', 'Delhi')
    console.log(d1);
    console.log(d2);
